            This is just a general list of all the classic games, and the role
            they played in gaming history.
          </p>
          <div id="picText">Doom</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/Doom2.png" alt="Doom Logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Well, here it is. The game that is heralded as the start of the
            First Person Shooter genre and was developed by Id Software. One of
            the reasons too we still have video games around today. This game
            goes at the top of the list because when you think classics, you
            can't help but think DOOM first.
          </p>
          <div id="picText">Deus Ex</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/Deus.png" alt="Deus Ex Logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Personal favorite, Deus Ex is regarded as one of the greatest role
            playings games of all time even despite its age today. The common
            joke "Every time somebody mentions Deus Ex somebody else goes to
            reinstall it" is soemthing that still goes on today. Developed by
            Ion Storm, it includes a lot of themes and explores conspiracy
            theories that are still discussed at length today. Good
            choice/consequence game as well, player actions early on can really
            come back to help or bite you later on!
          </p>
          <div id="picText">Half Life</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/HL.png" alt="Half Life Logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Developed by Valve Software, you play as a mute scientist with a
            crowbar. What is there to not love? Another classic in the FPS
            genre, it was also heralded for its puzzles that really challenged
            the player to use their mind. And of course when one mentions Half
            Life the question of when the 3rd installment is coming out usually
            follows short behind. So, I'll be the first to ask, when is HL3
            happening Valve?

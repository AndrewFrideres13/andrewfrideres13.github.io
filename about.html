                  I love playing with all kinds of technology, from the new, to
                  the old. I also have experience with Agile programming
                  practicum, and tend to have an old school mindset on just
                  about everything, from music, to values, to work ethic, and
                  this translates into a lot of who I am. In my spare time I
                  like to play a lot of old school games such as DOOM, pick up a
                  new programming language, or start a new project and just plug
                  away at that. Link to my resume

                  A game i started my first semester of college to show off my
                  love of DOOM in a platformer format, and for me to learn a lot
                  about JavaScript. I use the Phaser game engine prior to their
                  version 3 patch, and while it isn't the prettiest, as time
                  goes on and I learn new tricks of the trade, I've found myself
                  revisiting it to try something new, update my game to see how
                  it works with newer versions, or just trying weird Javascript
                  gimmicks and getting them to work alongside it. Follow the
                  associated link above to try it out!

                  My role in the group was to combine, test, and ensure we had a
                  deliverable to show off every week. I also had to be able to
                  sit town with team members and have them talk about their
                  additions so that we could log it, and assist in any debugging
                  and merging since that fell into my job role.This was my
                  Capstone project at CVTC and my test for everything I had
                  learned.

                  My role in this group was to assist with the front end GUI
                  design and CSS styles using bootstrap. In addition I did a
                  page on the history of battleships as a bit of context, and I
                  ended up being a scribe for our group meetings every week.
                  This assignment was a part of my course learning Agile, and so
                  for the first time, I had to work together with a group in
                  order to deliver a product.

                  A program i made using Visual Studio (2015 initially, updated
                  to 2017), it uses a GUI to allow the user to add, remove, and
                  edit games connected to a mySQL Database and then upon
                  execution does a sort of "spin" to run through all the games
                  and select one, complete with fun sound effects!

                  A game I did using Swift 2.0, it's more or less a clone of the
                  classic Asteroids game from way back in the day. It is
                  developed to scale gracefully depending on the size of the
                  phone, and has states for playing, power ups, and game over
                  conditions.

                  My first time using Unity, a game made with Haley Peterson at
                  Stout for my GDD 200 class. In this game you play as a little
                  ghost boy in their quest to restore color to the bleak world.

                  Made at Stout in my GDD 325 class, in Lackluster your goal is
                  to activate all the orbs in order to restore the light to the
                  world. The game was made using Phaser 3.0, and made use of an
                  npm server on the back end

                  Part of my 450 GDD Capstone, a 3D action adventure game made in Unity,
                  You play as a shipwrecked Viking who has crashed on an island within the arctic. 
                  Fitted with only your fishing rod, you set out to catch fish in order to survive the ordeal. 
                  After wandering the island for a time, you discover an altar deep within the island dedicated to Njord, God of the Sea. 
                  Offering some of your bounty to Njord, he aids you by turning your rod into a weapon capable of surviving the terrors of the night to come...

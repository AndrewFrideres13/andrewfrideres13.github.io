          <div id="picText">Metal Gear 5</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/Mod.jpg" alt="Metal Gear 5 logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Recently released, and already contending for GOTY Metal Gear 5
            gives the player true freedom to roam around and do whatever they
            want. Want to raid a base? Go for it. Want to do it in the middle of
            the day? Sure. Want to go in under the cover of a storm? Go for it.
            This is just a simple way of looking at it, but the game offers a
            freedom not known yet to gaming. I'll also admit, it looks pretty
            sweet.

          <div id="picText">Killing Floor 2</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/KF2.png" alt="Killing Floor 2 logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Another personal favorite, it combines the classic zombie killing
            action, with one of the most advanced gore systems known to gaming
            (as of 2015.) Still in Early Access on Steam, the game is already in
            a playable state, that ha vey few bugs at all in it. Constantly
            being updated as well, Tripwire Interactive knows just how to keep
            the fanbase returning to their game.

          <div id="picText">Witcher 3</div>
          <h3><img src="./Pics/W3.jpg" alt="Witcher 3 logo" /></h3>
          <p>
            Created by CD Projekt Red, the Witcher 3 is one of the few RPG's
            that truly looked at the choice/consequence system that Deus Ex had,
            and actually implemented it. I could go so far as to say it's one of
            the best modern day RPG's out there, one that will be looked back on
            as being truly groundbreaking and revolutionary.

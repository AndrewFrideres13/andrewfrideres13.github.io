My personal portfolio with some examples of
projects I've worked on and a neat DOOM theme
to it. Made using JQuery, Codrops rotator example,
years of schooling, trial, and error. Enjoy! =)
(Credit for images go to their respective 
owners, I do not own DOOM, and am not affiliated 
with ID Software in any way.)

              I love playing with all kinds of technology, from the new, to the
              old. I also have experience with Agile programming practicum, and
              tend to have an old school mindset on just about everything, from
              music, to values, to work ethic, and this translates into a lot of
              who I am. In my spare time I like to play a lot of old school
              games such as DOOM, pick up a new programming language, or start a
              new project and just plug away at that. Link to my resume

              My role in the group was to combine, test, and ensure we had a
              deliverable to show off every week. I also had to be able to sit
              town with team members and have them talk about their additions so
              that we could log it, and assist in any debugging and merging
              since that fell into my job role.This was my Capstone project at
              CVTC and my test for everything I had learned.

              My role in this group was to assist with the front end GUI design
              and CSS styles using bootstrap. In addition I did a page on the
              history of battleships as a bit of context, and I ended up being a
              scribe for our group meetings every week. This assignment was a
              part of my course learning Agile, and so for the first time, I had
              to work together with a group in order to deliver a product.

              A program i made using Visual Studio (2015 initially, updated to
              2017), it uses a GUI to allow the user to add, remove, and edit
              games connected to a mySQL Database and then upon execution does a
              sort of "spin" to run through all the games and select one,
              complete with fun sound effects!

              A game I created using Swift 2.0, it's more or less a clone of the
              classic Asteroids game from way back in the day. It is developed
              to scale gracefully depending on the size of the phone, and has
              states for playing, power ups, and game over conditions.

              My first time using Unity, this is a 2D sidescroller game built
              for touchscreen Android devices, made with Haley Peterson (artist)
              at UW-Stout for my GDD 200 class 2019. In this game you play as a
              little ghost boy in their quest to restore color to the bleak
              world, with a unique mechanic of using an Android devices built in
              gyroscope to control where the flashlight you use aims, using it
              to cut through the dark and expose the world of color below to
              solve puzzles & progress.

              (Programmer), Lex Klusman (Artist), and Joshua Haakana (Artist) in
              Lackluster your goal is to activate all the orbs in order to
              restore the light to the world. The game was made using Phaser
              3.0, and made use of an npm server on the back end, the ultimate
              goal was to make a fun, easy to play game for the Madison
              Children's Museum to put on as an interactive exhibit.
